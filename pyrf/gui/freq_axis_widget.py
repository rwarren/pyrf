    This replaces the normal x tick labels with labls that indicate the start, center, and stop frequencies.
    
    To use it, this just needs to be added to the PlotItem constructor for
    the 'bottom' axisItem, as follows:
    
        axisItems=dict(bottom = RTSAFrequencyAxisItem())
    
    This axis works by:
      1) disabling the normal tick labels
           - showValues = False
      2) forcing there to be space available for our new labels
           - we override setHeight
      3) injecting new labels into the drawing flow where it would normally
          expect the "classic" tick labels
           - we intercept generateDrawSpecs
